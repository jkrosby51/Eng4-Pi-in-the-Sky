# Eng4-Pi-in-the-Sky

- [Planning](#planning)
- [About Us](#about-us)

## Planning

**Description**: A small robot controlled by a Rasberry Pi will be lifted into the air by helium balloons. As it rises, it will collect altitude data and send messages to a phone that vary based on the detected altitude. Once it reaches a certain altitude, the ballons will drop the robot, which will then enter a state of freefall, safely landing on the ground.

**Test of Success**: The pi will consistently collect altitude data and send it back with vthe cor`rect message. It will also drop at the correct altitude and land safely/survive.

### What We Need to Learn

- Different versions of design to minimize impact
- Basic app development
- Either Bluetooth or LoRa communication
